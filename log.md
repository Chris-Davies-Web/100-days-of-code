# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I setup a node environment so I can easily work through the examples in the book. I started on the Effective JS book, going reading about Numbers (and a sidepath of Bitwise operators, 32bit ints and 64bit doubles), implicit coercion (how JS will convert types before operations), primitive types, and the === operator.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed the tasks today, much was a refresher but I did learn more about bitwise operators, something I haven't delved into before. Good to get a couple hours before work, I'm writing this log after work and I don't think I'll have the energy to do another couple hours.

### Missed a day for personal reasons. 

### Day 2: February 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 'automatic semicolon insertaion', how strings are represented in Unicode and a great example of closures!

**Thoughts:** Today was good, learned lots again on topics that I thought I already knew pretty well!

### Day 3: February 19, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 1.5 hours before a long days work. Finished chpater 2, hoisting, scope and never use eval!

**Thoughts:** Some indepth learning about things I already knew, really good refresher.

### Day 4: February 20, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 1.5 hours again, working through functions, method and constructors. Higher order functions, call, apply and variadic functions. Lots here I knew of but didn't use or understand.

**Thoughts:** Variadic functions is a new term, meaning a function which has variable-arity (arity being the number of arguments), as opposed to fixed-arity! Was a tired day after painting my front room but managed to squeeze in some time and I'm greatful for it!

### Day 5: February 21, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: In depth look at the arguments array for functions

**Thoughts:** Today was a struggle, early start to paint the living room, 3 hour walk with Jackson and Henly, when it came to working I was knackered. Managed to work for an hour but didn't make much progress, re-read each page about a million times. An hour done though!

### Day 6: February 25, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Functions chapter, learning about bind and currying.

**Thoughts:** After 3 days off due to losing my cat and spending my spare time looking for him, I got back into it. Was good and I enjoyed learning about currying and closures a bit more. I will try to use this in my code at work today.
