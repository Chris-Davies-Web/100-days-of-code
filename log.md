# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I setup a node environment so I can easily work through the examples in the book. I started on the Effective JS book, going reading about Numbers (and a sidepath of Bitwise operators, 32bit ints and 64bit doubles), implicit coercion (how JS will convert types before operations), primitive types, and the === operator.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed the tasks today, much was a refresher but I did learn more about bitwise operators, something I haven't delved into before. Good to get a couple hours before work, I'm writing this log after work and I don't think I'll have the energy to do another couple hours.
